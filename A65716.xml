            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THere are ſome common Notions and Inclinations to Devotion planted in the minds of men, which prompt them to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that which they eſteem <hi>Religion;</hi> and theſe, in the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> are very much improv'd by Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inſtruction, by the Miniſtry of the Word and publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, by the common workings of the Spirit of God and the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of good men; ſo that as many of them as are not <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> in heart, can never ſatisfie the workings of their Conſcience, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſome things which carry in them the appearance of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> Converſation, and from which they conclude themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and truly pious. But yet, alas, it doth too often happen, through the blindneſs of our Underſtandings, and the averſeneſs of our corrupt Wills to the ſeverer Duties of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> through the ſubtilty of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and the deceitfulneſs of our own Hearts, through the ſtrong affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which we bear to our beloved Luſts, and through the prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our Paſſions over the Reaſon and the Convictions of the Soul; I ſay it doth too often happen upon theſe accounts, that men delude themſelves with a fair ſemblance of <hi>Religion,</hi> without the Subſtance of it, <hi>Having a form of Godlineſs, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which, being in the experience of all Ages, and more eſpecially of this, a very common thing, and yet moſt certainly deſtructive to our precious Souls, it is both very neceſſary, and very profitable to deal plainly with you in this important Subject, by ſhewing,</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Wherein conſiſts <hi>the Form of Godlineſs,</hi> and how far we may go in the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and in the Practice of ſome Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and not exceed that <hi>Form.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wherein conſiſts the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>Now the Word <hi>Godlineſs</hi> in Scripture is ſometimes uſed in a ſtrict Senſe, to ſignifie that Service which is immediately paid to God, and is compriſed in the firſt Table of the <hi>Decalogue.</hi> As, <hi>v. g.</hi> When the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth exhort ſo <hi>follow after Righteouſneſs,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.11. 2 Pet. 1.7.</note> Godlineſs, Faith, Love, Patience, Meekneſs,</hi> to <hi>add to Godlineſs, Brotherly Kindneſs, and Charity;</hi>

                  <p>But when the Goſpel is ſtiled <hi>the Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the Reſolution of that important Queſtion, <hi>How far a Man may go in the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity and the performance of ſome religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Duties, and yet have only a bare form of Godlineſs?</hi> I anſwer in theſe ſix Particulars.</p>

                  <p>Again, I hope that none who hear me will be ſo profane as to make uſe of any thing now ſaid, to the diſcredit of <hi>Religion,</hi> to the defaming of any pious Perſons of what ſort ſoever; that none will take occaſion hence to call them <hi>Phariſees,</hi> or only <hi>formal Chriſtians,</hi> who pray much in their Families, hear Sermons frequently, and perform other pious Duties, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they do nothing repugnant to the Power of Godlineſs. 'Tis chiefly they who bear a Hatred to both the Power and the Form, that do ſo: and in their Language, as well as in the <hi>jewiſh Talmud,</hi> a <hi>Phariſee</hi> is a devout and pious Man; a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> is any one who will not be profane, and all muſt be <hi>Fanaticks</hi> who will not run with them into the ſame Exceſs of Riot.

They, by their outward Worſhip,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45273:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>give God the Honour of his Sovereignty and of his Greatneſs; they, by their Prayers, acknowledge his Omnipotence and his Ability to help us, his kindneſs and his readineſs to hear and give a gracious Anſwer to the Prayers of his humble Supplicants; by their Addreſſes to him in their Streights and Exigencies they own his over-ruling <hi>Providence;</hi> and by their publick Praiſes they acknowledge him to be their noble Benefactor, and the ſole Author of all the Mercies they enjoy; they bring ſome credit to Religion by keeping up the Reputation and Profeſſion of it, and ſeeming ſo concerned to promote it; whereas God and Religion are exceedingly diſhonoured by the profane and wicked Man. And therefore 'tis not to be wondered, that <hi>Providence</hi> ſhould rather chuſe to countenance even this Form of Godlineſs, than to permit that <hi>profane</hi> Spirit to reign, which doth ſo horribly blaſpheme the Name and Doctrine of our Lord and <hi>Saviour.</hi> And if our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> be ſtill in danger from the <hi>Scribe</hi> and <hi>Phariſee,</hi> they are as much in danger from the <hi>Publican and Sinner.</hi>

<note place="margin">1 John 4.20.</note> for <hi>he who loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> and all our ſpecious Pretences and high Attainments,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.2.

But 'tis the Power of Godlineſs alone which will enable us to love our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to be ſweet and kind in our Behaviour towards all men, to rejoyce in their Proſperity, ſympathize with them in their Miſeries, relieve their Wants, redreſs their Evils, and contribute as much as in us lies unto their Happineſs, to be patient towards our offending Brother, ready to forgive, and eaſie to be reconciled to him.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Power of Godlineſs, where it reſides, will certainly expreſs it ſelf in Acts of Righteouſneſs and Juſtice, 'twill make us honeſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and fair-dealing men; careful to do no Injury to any, and ready ſtill to deal with others as we would be dealt with. So that in reference to the fifth Commandment, to be a juſt and upright Perſon is to give due Reſpect and Honour to my <hi>Superiours,</hi> both <hi>natural, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual;</hi> not to permit my Heart to curſe, or cauſleſly to judge or cenſure them, or my Tongue to <hi>ſpeak Evil of Dignities.</hi> In reference to the ſixth Commandment, 'tis to preſerve the Life of others as much as in me lies, and to do nothing that may render it uncomfortable, when it is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45273:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>in my Power to avoid ſo doing; to bear no Envy, Hatred, or Malice to my Neighbour, nor to indulge to any thought of doing miſchief to him. In reference to the ſeventh, 'tis to preſerve our ſelves and others from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, not to deſire any luſtful Converſe with them, or cauſe the Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Faith which they have pledged to others. In reference to the eighth, 'tis to preſerve my Neighbours Goods, not to defraud him of any thing which he poſſeſſeth, either by Words, as Lying, and falſe Swearing, Colluſions, or Equivocations; or by our Deeds, as Stealing, Robbing, Over-reaching, Taking advantage of his Ignorance, or any other way; not to with-hold from any man his due, whether what we with-hold be due by Virtue of our Promiſe, or his Labour, his Truſt repoſed in us, or our Treſpaſs committed againſt him. In reference to the ninth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, to be a righteous honeſt man, is to be careful to preſerve our Brothers Credit and good Name, not to defame him either by raiſing or ſpreading ſcandalous Reports againſt him, or willingly receiving them from others. Laſtly, in reference to the tenth Commandment, it is to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate our Deſires, ſo that we do not envy others that Good which they enjoy, or long to have it in our own Poſſeſſion; this being that Injuſtice of the Heart, which prompts us to proceed to the Injuſtice of the Hand. And albeit this honeſt Man hath been of late decry'd as a mere <hi>moral Man,</hi> by thoſe who too much wanted <hi>Honeſty</hi> themſelves, yet is the practice of it repreſented, both in the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, that true Godlineſs conſiſts not in the outward Acts of Worſhip, or any of thoſe things in which I placed the Form of Godlineſs, but in the Regulation of our Paſſions, the Reſignation of our Wills unto the Will of God, in Purity of Heart, and a prevailing Love to God, and in the Acts of Charity and Juſtice to our Brother, will be farther evident,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From our <hi>Lord's</hi> Sermon in the <hi>Mount,</hi> which doth moſt fully preſs upon us the Performance of the higheſt Acts of Charity and Juſtice, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Doing unto others as we would be dealt with, but is not ſo ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous in preſſing outward Acts of Worſhip, which it doth only teach us to perform in a due manner, and ſo as to prevent that great Hypocriſie which was committed by the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbies</hi> in their Prayers and Faſtings. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, among all the Bleſſings with which our Lord begins that Sermon, we find not one pronounced upon the Man that prays, or hears, or faſts or offers a large Sacrifice, or that is nice, and zealous, but only on <hi>the pure in Heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 7.21, 24.</note> the <hi>merciful,</hi> and the <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> the man that <hi>thirſteth after Righteouſneſs,</hi> that hearing <hi>doth the Will of God.</hi> The Precepts of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> which in that Sermon <hi>Chriſt</hi> interprets, and reſcues from the falſe <hi>Gloſſes</hi> of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> are chiefly thoſe which do concern the Duties of the ſecond Table, and do preſcribe the Offices of Love and Juſtice to our Neighbour; the things which he there cautions us againſt, and chiefly labours to prevent, are <hi>cauſleſs Anger, fleſhly Luſts, Vain-glory</hi> and <hi>Revenge, cenſorious Judging, worldly Cares,</hi> and <hi>covetous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</hi> And laſtly, in that very Sermon he informs us, That he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly renounce at the laſt day ſome <hi>eminent Profeſſors,</hi>

When any Man conſulted him touching the things required to the obtainment of eternal Life, he never did direct them to make long Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to offer coſtly Sacrifices, or to be much in faſting, but to be diligent in the performance of Love to God, and of the Duties of the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;

Now means are all inferiour to, and only good as they conduce unto the end.

                     <hi>Paul</hi>'s way of reaſoning touching the Grace of Charity, theſe muſt be Duties of an higher nature. Laſtly, could we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to thoſe Perfections in which I place the Power of Godlineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe outward means, they would be both accepted and rewarded by God; whereas without theſe Diſpoſitions all our praying, hearing, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, faſting, are an Abomination to God, and only tend to aggravate our future doom. 'Twill be the Aggravation of our future Miſery, that, having been ſo well acquainted, by hearing, and by reading, with our <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Will, we have not done it, our Prayers and Faſtings will be ſad Indications of our great Hypocriſie; they will accuſe us of mocking the Almighty, when by them we profeſs'd our great deſire to have ſtrength for the performance of his Will, our willingneſs to be revenged upon our ſelves for the Omiſſion of it, and yet when Grace ſufficient was vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed did not improve it. This will convince us of our inſincerity in our pretended Zeal for the promotion of God's Glory, and fear in leſſer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to offend him, that we had no true Zeal againſt thoſe Sins which reigned in us, nor did make Conſcience of obſerving the more eſſential and weighty matters of the Law.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, We have ſeen the Exactneſs of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> in the performance of theſe outward things, and how exceeding confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they were on theſe Accounts of Favour and Acceptance with God; and we have alſo ſeen with what great ſharpneſs our Lord rebukes their Confidence, ſtill repreſenting theſe renowned <hi>Rabbies</hi> as the vileſt <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi>

And therefore God ſeems much concern'd to let them know that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted not in their Oblations,
<note place="margin">Amos 5.21.</note> that <hi>he hated and deſpiſed their Feaſt-days, and would not ſmell in their ſolemn Aſſemblies;</hi> that <hi>their burnt Offerings were not acceptable,

                  <p n="1">1. That we are very prone to reſt in the performance of theſe outward Duties, and to be confident that they will purchaſe for us the Favour of the God of Heaven, although we do not add unto them thoſe inward Fruits of Righteouſneſs in which the Power of true Godlineſs conſiſts: for wherefore was our Lord and all theſe <hi>holy Prophets</hi> ſo concerned to warn men of this great Miſtake, were they not very prone to fall into it?</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:45273:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p n="2">2. That we are naturally averſe from thoſe ſpiritual Duties in which the Life and Power of true Godlineſs conſiſts; for were it otherwiſe, why do the <hi>Holy Prophets</hi> and our dear Lord ſo oft inculcate, and with ſuch Vehemence exhort men to perform them? And,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Form of Godlineſs, without the Power of it, will be ſo far from miniſtring to our Acceptance here, or Happineſs hereafter, that it will be thrown back as Dung into our Faces, and be the greateſt Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our future doom: for if God ſo deſpiſed, and with ſo great Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination did reject the Service of the <hi>Jews</hi> when 'twas not joyned with Obedience and inward Purity, with Acts of Charity and Juſtice, albeit their Religion was full of Shadows and of outward Ceremonies; how much more will he loath the Service of the formal <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> from whom he chiefly doth require a ſpiritual Worſhip, and an inward Holineſs? And oh! what pity is it that we who do ſo much to go to Heaven, ſhould do it to ſo bad or little purpoſe, that we ſhould wholly loſe the benefit and comfort of all our Prayers and Faſtings, Hearing and Reading, for want of Care to do what we do hear and read, and by our Prayers and Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſeem deſirous to do! or, that for want of doing more, we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to reject with Hatred and Abomination what we have already done.</p>
                  <p>We being therefore apt to lie under theſe ſad Miſtakes which tend to the deſtruction of our precious Souls, can any of us take it ill that we are thus forewarned of them? Is it not reaſonable to preſs us to perform thoſe things which are ſo neceſſary to our Salvation and Acceptance with God, and from which we are naturally ſo averſe?</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, Beloved, let me beſeech you not to reſt in any outward Form of Godlineſs, but to advance unto the Power of it, by the ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Wills unto the Will of God, and a prevailing Love unto him, by the due Moderation of your Paſſions and Affections, and the Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Hearts from Anger, Malice, Envy, uncharitable Cenſures, Pride and Self-conceit, unclean and wicked Thoughts. Let us be careful that our Piety expreſs it ſelf in conſtant Acts of univerſal Charity, and Mercy, Juſtice, and upright Converſation towards Men, and in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Frame of Spirit: for if we only do expreſs it by liſting of our ſelves to ſuch a Party or Perſwaſion, or being zealous for it, by going to the Church, hearing a Sermon there, repeating it at home, faſting, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacrament, and leave theſe greater things undone, we only mock God with an outward Shew; but if unto this Form we add thoſe things in which the Life of Piety conſiſts, we have obtained that Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>which hath the Promiſe of this Life, and that which is to come.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. From thoſe Expreſſions of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which reprehend and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively condemn all evil Speeches of the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> which ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the Gods,
<note place="margin">Exod. 22.28.</note> nor ſpeak Evil of the Ruler of thy People;</hi> againſt which Text St. <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth he offended, when he ſaid to the <hi>High-Prieſt, God ſhall ſmite thee, thou whited Wall,</hi> altho that <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> even then commanded that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be ſmitten <hi>contrary to the Law,</hi>

Now hence I argue thus; If we may not <hi>ſpeak Evil of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the People,</hi> much leſs may we act Evil againſt him; if we may not revile him with the Tongue, we may not ſmite him with the Fiſt; if we may not ſay unto him <hi>thou art wicked,</hi>

<note place="margin">1 Kings 12.19.</note> It is not ſaid in Scripture that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> rebelled againſt the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> but that <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſo: their Action plainly ſeemeth to have been <hi>Rebellion,</hi> becauſe it was an actual renouncing of their lawful <hi>Sovereign,</hi> without God's Warrant to them ſo to do; for they do with one Voice cry out, <hi>What Portion have we in David, and what Inheritance have we in the Son of Jeſſe,</hi> and thereupon depart from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and appoint <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45273:19"/>their <hi>King,</hi> without any Commiſſion from God to do ſo. Moreover, they do this not out of any pretence of God's rejecting <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> but only for this Cauſe, That he refuſed to make their Yoke eaſie, and to remove the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Burthens which his Father had laid upon them; and therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted upon Rebellious Principles. For, as a <hi>Father</hi> doth not forfeit his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over his Children, nor are they freed from that Obedience which they owe unto him by virtue of the Fifth Commandment, becauſe he deals ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them, and is not to indulgent to, or careful of them as he ought to be; ſo neither can the <hi>King, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> of his Country, loſe his Authority over his Subjects, becauſe he governs them ſeverely, or lays afflicting Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens on them; nor can their Subjects be diſobliged from that Obedience which they owe unto them upon thoſe Accounts; for if <hi>Servants,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, are to <hi>obey</hi> ſuch <hi>Maſters</hi> who are <hi>froward</hi> and <hi>perverſe,</hi> i. e. ſevere in their Commands,

But as for <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> he only took what God had promiſed to give him, by rending of ten Tribes out of the hands of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and in that very method in which it pleaſed God to make good his Promiſe; for the Text doth expreſly ſay, this matter <hi>was from God,</hi> that <hi>he might perform the Saying which the Lord ſpake by Ah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Ye ſhall not go up, nor fight againſt your Brethren the Children of Iſrael, for this thing is from me.</hi> I therefore think of this whole matter thus; That <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was not guilty of any Uſurpation which might render him a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt <hi>Rehoboam;</hi> that the People were <hi>Rebellious</hi> in the Principle which moved them to revolt, and in revolting without Commiſſion from God; but that upon this Declaration made by God's <hi>Prophet</hi> it became their Duty to own, and to ſubmit to <hi>Jeroboam</hi> as their <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing Chriſt came not to take away, or to diminiſh any of the Rights of <hi>Princes,</hi> but rather to eſtabliſh and confirm them: Hence I infer, That the Reſiſtance, whether in Word or Deed, which was forbidden in the Old, cannot be rationally thought to be approved in the New Teſtament; but rather we may rationally judge, that as our Saviour came to advance the other Duties of the Moral Law; ſo much more, by his ſuffering Religion, to advance this moral Precept of Honour and Submiſſion to our <hi>Superiours.</hi> To which effect it is excellently obſerved by a very Learned Prelate,
<note place="margin">The Lord Biſhop of <hi>Sarum.</hi>
                     </note> That <hi>we find Chriſt and his Apoſtles frequently labouring to ſettle in the Conſciences of men</hi> their Obligations to <hi>Obedience,</hi> and patient ſuffering where they cannot active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey, <hi>but no where reſtraining, limiting, or particularly regulating the Office of Sovereign Powers</hi> (much leſs permitting, or giving Power to their Subjects to limit or reſtrain their Power) <hi>but leaving them to thoſe general Rules which concern the Account and Duty of all Men in their ſeveral Stations, and to the

                  <p>Moreover they in vain unite for mutual defence under a <hi>Governor,</hi> who, when they have done this, cannot defend themſelves againſt Natural Force; they cannot thus defend themſelves, whoſe Strength is not united; whence it doth clearly follow, That there muſt be a Power in the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> whereſoever that is lodged, to unite as many of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for the defence of the Community, as ſhall ſeem neceſſary to him for that end.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> A <hi>Supreme Governor</hi> muſt be inveſted with that Power which is neceſſary for the adminiſtration of Juſtice, the ſecuring Property, and the preſerving peace and quiet in his own Dominions.

<note place="margin">Num. 16.33.</note> they <hi>went down quick into Hell, and the Earth cloſed upon them,</hi> and ſo they <hi>periſhed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Congregation.</hi> God did deſtroy them by an unuſual death to render their iniquity more dreadful to the world. Accordingly St. <hi>Jude</hi> informs us of the firſt Chriſtian Rebels, thoſe <hi>filthy Dreamers,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 11.</note> who deſpiſed Dominions,</hi> that they did <hi>periſh in the gainſaying of Core;</hi> in which words the <hi>Apostle</hi> uſeth the Aoriſt for the future Tenſe, ſpeaking of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as a thing paſt already, becauſe he knew that Vengeance would not ſuffer them to live, for thoſe impure <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> and <hi>Carpocratians,</hi> of whom St. <hi>Jude</hi> is by ſome thought there to ſpeak, rebelled with <hi>Barcho Cheba,</hi> and with him they periſhed, ſaith the learned <hi>Grotius.</hi> They who deſpiſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45273:25"/>Dominions are by St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Jude</hi> declared to be men <hi>of old ordained to condemnation,</hi> that is, God hath of old declared his reſolution to condemn ſuch men. <hi>Woe unto them,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Jude, for God will execute his judgments on them for their ungodly deeds; Their judgment,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter, doth not lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and their damnation ſlumbers not;</hi> ſo that if they eſcape the hand of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice here, they have juſt reaſon to conclude they are reſerved for condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world to come, for as St <hi>Paul</hi> declares, <hi>He that reſiſteth ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive damnation.</hi>

                  <p>THe two former Sermons were committeá to the Preſs chiefly with a Deſign of doing Good to thoſe deluded Souls, who, by the Phariſaical Opinions, and the falſe Characters, and Signs of Godlineſs, which are too frequent in the Writings of our late Diſſenters, were gull'd into a fond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that they had the Power of Godlineſs, when they had ſcarce attained to the Form; and who were leaven'd with, and were encourag'd by their Rebellious Principles to that Reſiſtance of the Higher Powers, to which Damnation is moſt plainly threatned in the Holy Scripture; finding therefore by Diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Nelthrop,</hi> who ſent for me when he was in our County Priſon, that the Ring-leaders of the late Rebellion chiefly relied upon the Principles of the late Author of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, for the Justificatian of their Treaſonable Practices againſt His preſent Majesty, whom God preſerve; I thought it proper
<pb facs="tcp:45273:27"/>in purſuance of the Deſign aforeſaid, to add this Sermon to them, though it contains ſomethings already handled in the ſecond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it fully, and I hope convincingly refuteth that Pernicious Principle ſlyly ſuggeſted by the Author of that Book. <hi>Viz.</hi>

                        </note> Vicegerents,</hi> or, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſtyles them, the <hi>Officers, and Miniſters of God.</hi> And ſeeing no man can lay claim to an Inferiour and Dependant Office and Juriſdiction, or regularly exerciſe that Power but by Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Appointment of a <hi>Superior Power</hi> in whom that Juriſdiction doth originally reſide, it follows that no <hi>Earthly Potentates,</hi> who in the exerciſe of the ſupremeſt of their juriſdictions muſt be Inferior to, and Dependant on <hi>the King of Kings,</hi> can be inveſted with Power over other men but by Commiſſion from, and by appointment of that God who is <hi>the King of all the Earth;</hi> and that they all have Reaſon to confeſs with David, <hi>Thine, O Lord,
<note place="margin">1 Chr. 29.</note> is the Kingdom.</hi> Now becauſe the acknowledgment, and firm belief, that this is the true Fountain and Original of Humane Power, doth moſt effectually tend to enforce that due Subjection and Obedience to it, which is ſo neceſſary to be preſſed in this Age of Factions and Rebellions, that <hi>We knowing whoſe Authority</hi> our Rulers <hi>have, may faithfully ſerve, honour, and humbly obey them in him, and for him;</hi> and that <hi>the Miniſter of God</hi> may alſo be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to exerciſe that Power with which by God he is intruſted, as moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to Gods Glory, That <hi>knowing whoſe Miniſter he is, he may above all things ſeek his Honour and Glory.</hi> I therefore judge it proper to inſiſt upon this Subject, which I ſhall proſecute with plainneſs and Sincerity; endeavouring to ſhew,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. What are the <hi>Powers</hi> mentioned in my Text.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. In what Senſe they are ſaid to be <hi>ordained by God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. What Evidence there is from Reaſon and from Scripture, that they are <hi>his Ordinance.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. What improvement may be made of this Doctrine.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45273:28"/>
                  <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> Men willing to diſpute themſelves into <hi>Rebellion,</hi> have been ſo <hi>Critical,</hi> and Nice as to diſtinguiſh here betwixt the <hi>Power,</hi> and the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> who is inveſted with it, confeſſing that indeed the Office of <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> is the Ordinance of God, but denying that the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> or Perſon who doth execute the Office, is <hi>his Ordinance.</hi> Fond and Abſurd! For it is as if I ſhould diſtinguiſh the Office of the <hi>Majoralty</hi> of <hi>Sarum</hi> from the <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Sarum,</hi> which Office neither is nor can be exerciſed but by a <hi>Mayor,</hi> and muſt be a bare name without him, and ſhould ſay, that <hi>the Majoralty of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> is the <hi>Kings Ordinance,</hi> but that the <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Sarum</hi> is not ſo. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The word here uſed is <hi>Powers,</hi> not <hi>Power</hi> in the ſingular, whereas no inſtance can be given in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and no propriety of Speech allows, that the <hi>Authority</hi> abſtractly taken ſhould be ſo ſpoken off. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Authority,</hi> abſtracted from the perſon Authoriſed, can never be the ſubject of what is here aſcribed to the <hi>Powers;</hi> for we cannot <hi>reſiſt,</hi> or yield obedience to the <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> but by reſiſting, or obeying him who is a <hi>Magiſtrate. Authority</hi> in the abſtract, where there is none to exerciſe it, cannot be <hi>feared,</hi> nor can it give us <hi>praiſe</hi> for doing well, nor be a <hi>terror,</hi> or an <hi>Avenger</hi> of wrath <hi>to him that doeth evil;</hi> it cannot receive <hi>Cuſtom, Tribute,</hi> or challenge <hi>fear,</hi> or <hi>honour;</hi> it therefore cannot be the bare <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> but only <hi>Authoriſed perſons</hi> to whom theſe duties are enjoyned, and theſe effects aſcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As if, St. <hi>Paul</hi> had actually deſigned to obviate this ſond eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he himſelf thus interprets the <hi>Powers</hi> to be <hi>the Rulers,</hi> and <hi>the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> in whom the <hi>Power</hi> is lodged; for thus he ſpeaks, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the higher powers,</hi> for <hi>Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> And again, <hi>Wilt thou not be afraid of the Power, do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame, for he is the Miniſter of God to thee for Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> plainly doth enjoin obedience to the <hi>Prince,</hi> who is inveſted with this power <hi>for the Lords ſake,</hi> whoſe Miniſter he is; ſaying, <hi>Be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake:—to the King as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme. And,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The deſign of the Sacred Writers of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was undoubtedly to ſecure the peace and quiet of the world, to forbid all <hi>Reſistance of the Higher Powers,</hi> and to ſtop the mouths of thoſe ignorant and fooliſh men, who repreſented <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> as prejudicial unto the <hi>Powers</hi> then in being, and apt to make diſturbance in the State; but if they laid no obligation on the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to own the <hi>Powers</hi> then in being as Gods Ordinance, but only to acknowledge in the General, that <hi>Civil Government</hi> is from God, how could their Doctrine anſwer theſe deſigns, ſeeing it leaveth men at liberty to reſiſt all who are inveſted with <hi>Authority,</hi> and by ſo doing to diſturb con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually the peace and quiet of the world? That therefore men ſhould ſtruggle againſt ſuch ſhining evidence of truth, may tempt us to ſuſpect, that they were as averſe from yielding due ſubjection to the <hi>word of God,</hi> as they were from conplying with the Commands of their <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45273:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> For explication of the firſt particular, I add, that the <hi>Powers</hi> here mentioned muſt not be extended to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers,</hi> or ſuch as have no <hi>Legal Title,</hi> in oppoſition unto thoſe who have Juſt Title, though by the prevalence of an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> they are unjuſtly kept from the enjoyment of their Right. For were this ſo, Might would give Right, and every <hi>proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Rebel</hi> would by that very Act commence God's Ordinance, and ſo be both a <hi>Rebel</hi> againſt God, and yet be his <hi>Vicegerent</hi> too; nor would men <hi>rule</hi> becauſe they are the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> but be the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> becauſe they <hi>rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, what is <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> but the aſſuming of a Power, to which, he that uſurps it, hath no lawful call, and no juſt title; ſince then the ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that God, who is the <hi>Sovereign</hi> of the world, muſt be a lawful call, and give the perſon thus ordained, a <hi>Legal Title</hi> to be his <hi>Vicegerent,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from the very nature of the act, that the Uſurper can not be Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. When the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> doth begin his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> by <hi>taking of the Sword,</hi> or wreſting it out of the hands of him who bears it by Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God, he muſt unqueſtionably be the <hi>Reſiſter of Gods Ordinance;</hi> how therefore can ſucceſs in his reſiſtance render him <hi>the Power?</hi> Is it not ſtrange that he who purchaſeth damnation by reſiſting, by the ſame act, and by the higheſt aggravation of it, even the depoſing of his lawful <hi>Prince,</hi> ſhould purchaſe a juſt title to <hi>Dominion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Could an Uſurped Poſſeſſion create a Right to <hi>Government,</hi> were it ſufficient to render the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuper Gods Vicegerent</hi> and <hi>his Ordinance,</hi> though he doth juſtle out the lawful <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> then muſt all Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions to preſerve the Government in the <hi>Right Line,</hi> and to condemn all <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations</hi> made upon it, become void, as being Laws enacted to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve, condemn and to reſiſt <hi>Gods Ordinance,</hi> and all our Oaths of <hi>yielding Faith and True Allegiance to the Kings Heirs, and Lawful Succeſſors,</hi> and of <hi>defending them unto the outmoſt of our Powers againſt all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers whatſoever,</hi> muſt be unlawful oaths. So plainly doth this Doctrine tend unto the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of our <hi>Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A man may poſſibly uſurp Dominion againſt Gods own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and deſignation of another perſon to be the <hi>Ruler</hi> of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Thus was it in the caſe of <hi>Abſalom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.18. Chap. 19.10.</note> for <hi>all the men of Iſrael choſe</hi> him in oppoſition to <hi>David;</hi> they <hi>anointed him over</hi> them, and yet the Holy Ghoſt doth forty times ſtyle David <hi>King,</hi> during the Uſurpation of his Son, but never doth vouchſafe that title to <hi>Rebellious</hi> Abſalom; whereas, if ſuch an Uſurpation could have rendred him <hi>Gods Ordinance,</hi> then muſt He <hi>Reign</hi> at the ſame time againſt, and yet according to <hi>Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Certain it is the <hi>Pope</hi> did long <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurp,</hi> and actually poſſeſs, and exerciſe a power over moſt of the <hi>European Kings</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms:</hi> If then bare Uſurpation would render any man <hi>the Ordinance of God,</hi> I know not how we could diveſt him of that Title, or throw of his <hi>Yoke</hi> without reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Higher Powers.</hi> And therefore to conclude this firſt particular, we by the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> are to underſtand, <hi>The Perſons lawfully intitled to their Government.</hi>

<note place="margin">Deut. 32.35.

Again, ſeeing all private Perſons are forbidden to avenge themſelves, ſeeing they are commanded to <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe to no man evil for evil,</hi> they cannot give that Power to another which they have not received from God, and which they are not Authoriſed by him, but rather are forbidden to exert; and ſo the <hi>Magistrate</hi> cannot be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45273:32"/>rationally ſuppoſed to receive this Power from them; and this ſeems written with a Sun beam in thoſe words of our <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> where of the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>He is the Miniſter of God; the Avenger of wrath to him that doth evil;</hi> behold, He is <hi>the Miniſter of God,</hi> not of the People, and his Vindictive Juſtice upon evil doers, is therefore to be feared, <gap reason="foreign">

I Anſwer, that it is exceeding evident, that no man doth make over ſuch a Right unto his Prince; for had he done it by owning himſelf ſubject to his Government, no Subject could defend his Life from the Aſſaults of Thieves, and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or other bloody Perſons, without aſſuming what they had given to their Sovereigns; ſince therefore Subjects do retain this Right as fully under Civil Governments, as in a ſtate of nature, they cannot be ſuppoſed by ſubmiſſion to their <hi>Governors</hi> to have abandoned, or parted with that Right, which doth ſo ſundamentally deſtroy the vain pretence, that it is needleſs to add more in confutation of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Supreme Governor,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, bears the Sword,</hi> that is, he hath the Power of Life and Death. Now, ſeeing God hath ſaid to every private man, <hi>thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> and ſince he hath not given to any man the Power to diſpoſe of his own Life, or to commit <hi>ſelf-murther,</hi> or to conſent that any one that will ſhall murther him; ſeeing 'tis evident from Reaſon that no man can confer that Power on another which he hath not received, it follows, that the People, who never had this Power over their own Lives, cannot impart it to the <hi>Magistrate.</hi> He therefore muſt receive it wholly from that God who giveth unto all men Life and Breath,
<note place="margin">Acts 17.25.</note> and therefore hath the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Right to be the ſole diſpoſer of them. And ſure that God who breatheth into man the Breath of Life, muſt have the ſole <hi>Dominion</hi> over his own Production; this Dominion conſequently can be communicated to none, but thoſe to whom by him it is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; to the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> it is committed by that Law of God which puts the Sword into his hand to cut off evil doers; and if the People, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will challenge the like Power, they muſt ſhew the like Charter; and if they cannot do ſo, as without doubt they cannot, this is ſufficient to diſprove all their pretences to give this Power to another.

Now though a Humane Law or Act of Parliament, may make that ſinful in its exerciſe which was before indifferent, it is not eaſie to conceive how it ſhould turn a neceſſary duty into the worſt of ſins, and transform the Glorious <hi>Martyr</hi> into the <hi>damned Rebel.</hi> 2. What Conviction ſo ever any Prince may have that the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Religion is New and Schiſmatical, or juſtly charged with <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> he cannot, by this Doctrine, attempt to change it, and to eſtabliſh true Religion in its place by any penalties impoſed upon the <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> or <hi>Schiſmatical,</hi> but he muſt be in danger of an Inſurrection, and by this very Act muſt authorize his Subjects to enquire with Sword and Piſtol in their hand, <hi>By what law muſt we ſuffer for profeſſing the eſtabliſhed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</hi> 3. This ſtrange Aſſertion juſtifies thoſe Rebels who endeavoured to hinder Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> whoſe inclinations, and diſaffection to the then eſtabliſhed Religion they well knew, from coming to the Crown and it condemns the <hi>Reformation both in this,</hi> and in all other Kingdoms, as being that by which the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> did ſuffer in their eſtates and Perſons for profeſſing of the eſtabliſhed Religion: if then this be ſufficient Ground for any Subjects to rebel againſt their lawful <hi>Soveraign,</hi> that their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is eſtabliſhed by Law, and they are like to ſuffer by his attempt to change it,

So evident is it that this Doctrine tends more <hi>to turn a Nation into Shambles,</hi> than that of being <hi>paſſively obedient.</hi> And <hi>Laſtly</hi> this Aſſertion is deſtructive of it ſelf, and never can contribute to the end for which it doth pretend to be deſigned, <hi>viz.</hi> The preſervation of the eſtabliſhed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion againſt the pleaſure of the <hi>Soveraign;</hi> for by What Laws are We authorized to reſiſt for Religions Sake, the Laws of God expreſly forbid it; By the Laws of the Land, but theſe Laws deprive all Subjects of any power to reſiſt the King by taking Arms againſt him?

<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.19, 20.</note> to take it patiently,</hi> and by that Law of God, and of the Land, which doth forbid <hi>reſiſtance of the Higher Powers by taking up the Sword;</hi> for when I cannot law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſiſt that power which will puniſh, I of neceſſity muſt ſuffer or tranſgreſs. When he adds, That <hi>no ſuch power is lodged in the Prerogative as to deſtroy men contrary to Law,</hi> it is as true that no ſuch power is lodged in the <hi>Supremacy</hi> as to deſtroy men contrary to Gods Law, or even to make a Law which contradicteth the Divine Law, and therefore no ſuch Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is given them from God as to deſtroy the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> for the Profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or for obeying Gods revealed will, or for not ſacrificing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Heathen Idols:</hi> And yet God did enjoin all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> when they did ſuffer upon theſe accounts, to ſuffer patiently, and not reſiſt. It is not therefore any <hi>Authority,</hi> which God hath given to the <hi>Prince</hi> to puniſh men for doing well, that binds the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> thus to ſuffer, but the plain Law of God, and of the Land, both which forbid them that reſiſtance which alone can hinder it. No <hi>Maſter</hi> hath Authority from God to deal perverſly with his <hi>Servant,</hi> no <hi>Parent</hi> to deal unnaturally and unjuſtly with his <hi>Child,</hi> but yet I hope this will not authorize them to reſiſt, and to rebel againſt <hi>Maſter,</hi> or <hi>Parent,</hi> when they thus ſuffer by them; and what can then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, but that they quietly do <hi>ſuffer wrongfully?</hi>
